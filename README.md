# BB8 Arduino

Samuel Piatanesi
Luca Ruschioni

We are two students of ITIS Meucci Castelfidardo, Italy.
We have developed a clone of BB-8, the famous droid of Star Wars VII.

We have used Arduino with USB Host Shield and Adafruit Motor Shield. You can control it with a common PS3 controller or with an Android app.

You can download the Arduino code: our project is OPEN-SOURCE, so you can edit the code and try to help us to improve the movement of our BB8!
